Thus, it is no surprise that the one he wants to kill the most is never far off from his mind: the class idol, Anna Yamada. Reading alone in his beloved school library, he inadvertently begins to rendezvous with Yamada, who comes to secretly gorge on her beloved candies and sweets. Through their interactions, Ichikawa discovers just how much of a ditz Yamada is, and can't help but support her from the sidelines. Meanwhile, Yamada herself can't help but tease Ichikawa relentlessly due to his flustered reactions. With an array of heartwarming daily interactions, the distant bond between the two grows into something more than just library acquaintances. Perhaps, in time, Ichikawa will come to realize that his murderous desires have turned into something else entirely.

Unluckily for him, he has a knack for attracting spirits. Two years ago, this connection had led to him receiving a spiritual injury on his right hand, with his friend getting caught in the crossfire. The event caused him to become a shut-in, leaving him with very poor social skills. Fortunately, Keitarou is slowly starting to mingle with society, thanks to the help of his childhood friend, Eiko Houzuki. As part of his rehabilitation, Keitarou takes on the part-time job of a private tutor, and his first pupil is none other than Eiko's cousin, Yayoi Houzuki. Besides being a child prodigy, there is another peculiarity regarding Yayoi—she has a spiritual constitution, just like Keitarou. However, in contrast to Keitarou, she yearns to encounter spirits, hoping to find the ghost that took her mother away. As Keitarou is dragged along by Yayoi and Eiko to haunted spots, his part-time job seems to be straying further and further away from its original purpose.

According to the narration in the series, the early history of Remnant has been long forgotten, with recollections being passed down in the form of myths and legends. In the world of Remnant, all living creatures possess a soul, the physical manifestation of which is known as Aura: a form of innate energy that bestows its user with certain abilities and powers. Semblances are expressions of this power and are akin to a personal superpower unique to each character. Remnant is populated by two intelligent species - Humanity and the Faunus, a species of Human-animal hybrids. All of the inhabitants of Remnant are beset by the Grimm, which are described as \"creatures of destruction\" and lack a soul. Huntsmen and Huntresses fight the Grimm and protect the peace of Remnant and its people. However, not all Huntsmen and Huntresses are good people with many usually only doing it for their own gain.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":52564,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/52564/Rick_and_Morty__The_Anime","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/img/sp/icon/apple-touch-icon-256.png"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":false,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Rick and Morty: The Anime"}],"title":"Rick and Morty: The Anime","title_english":null,"title_japanese":null,"title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Other","episodes":10,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":null,"to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Not available"},"duration":"20 min per ep","rating":null,"score":null,"scored_by":null,"rank":0,"popularity":0,"members":0,"favorites":0,"synopsis":null,"background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":52750,"url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/52750/SK∞_2nd_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1292/127028.jpg","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1292/127028t.jpg","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1292/127028l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1292/127028.webp","small_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1292/127028t.webp","large_image_url":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1292/127028l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"SK∞ 2nd Season"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"SK Eight"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Skate"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"SK∞ エスケーエイト"},{"type":"English","title":"SK8 the Infinity 2nd Season"}],"title":"SK∞ 2nd Season","title_english":"SK8 the Infinity 2nd Season","title_japanese":"SK∞ エスケーエイト","title_synonyms":["SK Eight","Skate"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":null,"status":"Not yet aired","airing":false,"aired":{"from":null,"to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Not available"},"duration":"Unknown","rating":"PG-13 -

For the past 10 years, Fuuko has been afflicted by a condition that brings extreme misfortune to anyone who touches her. This has had a drastic effect on her surroundings, even inadvertently resulting in the deaths of those around her—including her parents. As she stands on a bridge above train tracks, Fuuko is touched by a strange man, causing the footing underneath him to break and dropping him in front of an oncoming train. However, when Fuuko finds the man's corpse, she discovers that his body is regenerating and that he is coming back to life. The man, whom Fuuko names Andy, is immortal—and like her, he also wishes for death. Initially dismissive, Fuuko eventually decides to team up with Andy to give him the best death possible; but a mysterious organization lurks in the shadows, hoping to take advantage of the duo's bizarre abilities.
