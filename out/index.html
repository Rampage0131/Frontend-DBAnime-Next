talented and beautiful idol who is adored by her fans. She is the personification of a pure, young maiden. But all that glitters is not gold. Gorou Amemiya is a countryside gynecologist and a big fan of Ai. So when the pregnant idol shows up at his hospital, he is beyond bewildered. Gorou promises her a safe delivery. Little does he know, an encounter with a mysterious figure would result in his untimely death—or so he thought. Opening his eyes in the lap of his beloved idol, Gorou finds that he has been reborn as Aquamarine Hoshino—Ai&#x27;s newborn son! With his world turned upside down, Gorou soon learns that the world of showbiz is paved with thorns, where talent does not always beget success. Will he manage to protect Ai&#x27;s smile that he loves so much with the help of an eccentric and unexpected ally?

However, she one day finds herself in the midst of a scene from one of these games as the story&#x27;s villainess, Irene Loren D&#x27;Autriche. At the banquet to celebrate the end of the academy&#x27;s winter term, the crown prince and Irene&#x27;s childhood friend, Cedric Jeanne Elmeier, publicly annuls his engagement with Irene and announces that he is in love with Lilia Rainworth, the game&#x27;s female protagonist. Aware of the tragic future ahead of her and determined to change it, the young girl resolves to conquer the game&#x27;s final boss, the &quot;Demon King&quot; and Cedric&#x27;s half-brother, Claude Jeanne Elmeier, by making him fall in love with her instead. With time running out, can Irene succeed with her plans, or will she remain bound to the ill-fated ending that awaits her?

However, in high school, their relationship deteriorates. As Suzu&#x27;s one-sided feelings are growing, so is the difference in their ayakashi views: Matsuri considers all ayakashi a threat to his friend, while Suzu is an ayakashi medium—someone who exudes a significant amount of life force compared to the average human—and loves them all despite the risk. When the two stumble upon a talking white cat named Shirogane, they are unaware that it is a four-hundred-year-old ayakashi known as the &quot;King of Ayakashi.&quot; He is hell-bent on gaining even more power by devouring Suzu, but as Matsuri swoops in to try and save her by sealing Shirogane&#x27;s powers, the ayakashi uses a jutsu to turn him into a girl instead! Matsuri vows to protect Suzu from further harm as her best friend, but he must learn how to act like a girl until his grandfather—a famous wind jutsu exorcist ninja—can undo the jutsu. Meanwhile, Suzu must work out her romantic feelings for Matsuri now that he is no longer a boy. But when Matsuri takes the king as his pet, the future of the two friends seems uncertain.

Believing that Japan has lacked an egoistic striker hungry for goals, Jinpachi initiates the Blue Lock—a prison-like facility where three hundred talented strikers from high schools all over Japan are isolated and pitted against each other. The sole survivor of Blue Lock will earn the right to become the national team&#x27;s striker, and those who are defeated shall be banned from joining the team forever. Selected to join this risky project is Yoichi Isagi, a striker who failed to bring his high school soccer team to the national tournament. After choosing to pass to a teammate who missed instead of scoring on his own, he could not help but wonder if the results would have been different had he been more selfish. Using this golden opportunity given by the Blue Lock Project, Yoichi aims to clear his doubts and chase his ultimate desire—to become the greatest striker in the world and lead Japan to World Cup glory.

Motsuo, in particular, owns Meico, a beautiful robot that gives excellent massages and serves drinks with a smile. Jealous of his friend, Bondo convinces his mother to get him an OrderMaid, hoping for a similar experience. However, to Bondo&#x27;s surprise, the maid that appears outside of his door is incredibly muscular and clumsy enough to destroy a house when completing simple chores. Going by the name Roboko, this new robot is the exact opposite of what Bondo wanted. But despite that, Bondo, together with his friends, learns that there is more to Roboko than they could ever expect.

However, in high school, their relationship deteriorates. As Suzu's one-sided feelings are growing, so is the difference in their ayakashi views: Matsuri considers all ayakashi a threat to his friend, while Suzu is an ayakashi medium—someone who exudes a significant amount of life force compared to the average human—and loves them all despite the risk. When the two stumble upon a talking white cat named Shirogane, they are unaware that it is a four-hundred-year-old ayakashi known as the \"King of Ayakashi.\" He is hell-bent on gaining even more power by devouring Suzu, but as Matsuri swoops in to try and save her by sealing Shirogane's powers, the ayakashi uses a jutsu to turn him into a girl instead! Matsuri vows to protect Suzu from further harm as her best friend, but he must learn how to act like a girl until his grandfather—a famous wind jutsu exorcist ninja—can undo the jutsu. Meanwhile, Suzu must work out her romantic feelings for Matsuri now that he is no longer a boy. But when Matsuri takes the king as his pet, the future of the two friends seems uncertain.

Believing that Japan has lacked an egoistic striker hungry for goals, Jinpachi initiates the Blue Lock—a prison-like facility where three hundred talented strikers from high schools all over Japan are isolated and pitted against each other. The sole survivor of Blue Lock will earn the right to become the national team's striker, and those who are defeated shall be banned from joining the team forever. Selected to join this risky project is Yoichi Isagi, a striker who failed to bring his high school soccer team to the national tournament. After choosing to pass to a teammate who missed instead of scoring on his own, he could not help but wonder if the results would have been different had he been more selfish. Using this golden opportunity given by the Blue Lock Project, Yoichi aims to clear his doubts and chase his ultimate desire—to become the greatest striker in the world and lead Japan to World Cup glory.
